              Before its launch, Hubba Bubba had been referred to as "Stagecoach" during product development and early
              manufacturing at the now-defunct Wrigley plant in Santa Cruz, California. The earliest series of TV
              commercials for Hubba Bubba that aired in the United States were set in a Wild West town and featured a
              character known as the Gumfighter, played by actor Don Collier. At the end of each commercial, the Gum
              Fighter declared, "Big bubbles, no troubles," followed by a jocular response from Western film veteran Dub
              Taylor. This was a reference to Hubba Bubba being less sticky than other brands. Hubba Bubba's main
              competition for most of the 1980s was the brand Bubblicious.

              The original bubble-gum flavor was discontinued for many years in the United Kingdom, with only apple,
              strawberry, and cola flavors available. As of June 2012, flavors available in the UK include strawberry,
              original and apple. (In April 2012, the original flavor returned, with packs proclaiming "chunkier and
              bubblier"). Flavors available in Australia include cherry, cola, peach, strawberry, lime, pineapple,
